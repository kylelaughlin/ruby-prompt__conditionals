# What is a conditional?

Simply put, a conditional is: if some condition is met then do something. Many times, if that condition is not met 
then something else would happen (else).  A real life example of a conditional is "if it is very sunny and bright out 
then I will put on my sunglasses". My putting on sunglasses is dependent on the condition of it being sunny and bright 
being true. Conditionals in code would be represented by if-elsif-else statements, case/switch statements and loops 
(do while something is true).

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

A single = is used to set a value. If I were to write my_variable = 14 I would be saying set the value of the variable 
my_variable to the integer 14. Double == is used when checking if two pieces of information are equal to each other. Using 
the samve variable, if I wrote my_variable == 14 that would evaluate to the boolean value true. A single = assigns a value 
while double == checks if two things are the same or equal. On a side note if I had written my_variable == "14" it would 
evaluate to false due to the variable being an integer and "14" being a string which are not considered the same or equal.
